## Description

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution derived from Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software. Ubuntu is officially released in multiple editions: 
- **Desktop** (classic GUI based Desktop)
- **Server** (Terminal only) and 
- **Core** for Internet of things devices and robots. 

The operating system is developed by the British company Canonical and a community of other developers under a meritocratic governance model.

As of April 2024, the most-recent long-term support release is 24.04 ("Noble Numbat").
